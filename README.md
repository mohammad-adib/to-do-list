# To-Do-List
This is a simple **to-do list** created using [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) 3.4.1., [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) 4.4.1 and [jQuery-ui](https://jqueryui.com/) 1.12.1.

- Four different type of data can be added to the list -- Text, Date, Status, and Priority. 
- Columns and rows can be added, removed, and moved dynamically.
- The width of columns, and height of rows are fixed.
- All changes are instantly saved to localStorage and not lost when the page is refreshed.
